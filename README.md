The repository contains a requirements.txt file that contains the dependencies for the project.
So you can install the dependencies in a virtual environment:


```python
mkdir SEMINARS
git clone https://github.com/marcsirventruiz/ML4NET-Seminars.git
cd SEMINARS
python3 -m venv ML4NETvenv
source ML4NETvenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All should run fine when current directory is SEMINARS/.
